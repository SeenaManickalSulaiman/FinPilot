# FinPilot
## Overview
FinPilot is an AI-powered virtual financial assistant designed to provide users with intelligent, real-time insights into personal finance topics like budgeting, investing, and market trends. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), real-time financial tools, and API integrations to deliver accurate, customized responses tailored to each user's financial query.

## Problem Statement
Modern financial decision-making is complex and often inaccessible to everyday users due to:
* Information overload from financial markets
* Lack of personalized financial advice
* Inaccessibility of real-time analytics without costly consultants
* Difficulty in combining multiple financial needs (e.g., budgeting + investment) into a single recommendation

As a result, many individuals and small businesses struggle to make informed financial decisions effectively and affordably.

## Proposed Solution
FinPilot addresses these challenges by:
* Acting as a conversational AI assistant for financial queries
* Using real-time data (e.g., stock prices, market trends) via APIs
* Applying advanced analytics and LLM capabilities to provide contextual insights
* Offering natural language interaction, removing technical barriers for non-expert users
* Integrating tools like Tavily search, yFinance, and custom LLM prompts to enhance reasoning

Applications
* Personal Finance Guidance: Budget planning, savings tips, debt management strategies.
* Investment Advice: Sector trends, stock insights, portfolio diversification tips (non-financial-advisory disclaimer applies).
* Market Research Tool: Real-time market sentiment, stock comparisons, commodity updates.
* Educational Use: Learn financial concepts interactively (e.g., 50/30/20 rule, ETF vs. stock).
* Enterprise Use: Can be extended for financial advisors, banks, or fintech firms as a white-labeled chatbot solution.
